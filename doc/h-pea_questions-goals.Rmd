## Questions:
  - What are the components of a ggplot?
  - How do I create scatterplots, boxplots, and barplots?
  - How can I change the aesthetics (ex. colour, transparency) of my plot?
  - How can I create multiple plots at once?
  - How can I put multiple different types of plots into one plot?
  - How can I use my the same code for new data?
  - How can I use the same code for different modes of presentation (e.g., papers and slides)?

## Objectives:
   - Produce scatter plots, boxplots, and time series plots using ggplot.
   - Set universal plot settings.
   - Describe what faceting is and apply faceting in ggplot.
   - Modify the aesthetics of an existing ggplot plot (including axis labels and color).
   - Build complex and customized plots from data in a data frame.
   - Glue varied plot types together
   - Embed the same plot in a slide deck and a report.
